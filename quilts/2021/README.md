Review
------
* Synthetic insulation is much easier to work with than down, but harder than I expected.
* I did the seam along the bottom first, this was a mistake because I then had to do a second seam after folding the quilt in half.
* It's too narrow in the body, but could be narrowed at the knees.
* It could do with more quilting stitches attaching the insulation to the body.
* The fabric is very airtight, it doesn't pack down easily.
