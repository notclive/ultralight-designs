## Lessons

- I underestimated how much width I would need in the waist and thigh.
  - I rectified the waist but the thighs are still tight.
  - The SketchUp pattern isn't entirely accurate, if I'm remaking these I should work from the actual material.
- I made a mistake on the crotch french seam, I forgot to turn the trousers inside out.
  - This has lead to the excess fabric showing up on the outside.
  - This may be rectifiable in places, I may have enough room in the crotch to sew another seam.
- I struggled with the sewing.
  - This was my first time using this particular sewing machine, it needs a very high tension otherwise the thread snaps.
  - This has lead to a lot of bunching.
  - As always, my stitching is wonky.
- I used safety pins to test out the sizing, this has made holes in the fabric.
- I used a chalk pen for the first time and that worked well.
  - It was easy to see the markings.
