Often feels like it's tipping back. Can I move the weight over the shoulders?
This could also be due to where the vest attaches, looking in the mirror it doesn't look like it fits well.
The vest was an XL size, which hopefull provides larger pockets, but is going to be too large for me.

I could go wider, it's unnecessarily narrow.
