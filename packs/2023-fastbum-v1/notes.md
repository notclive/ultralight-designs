Comments
--------
Early testing shows that it can hold 4kg.
The hipbelt wants to sit on the waist not the hips, which isn't comfortable, try lowering the hipbelt.

The pattern lead to the stash pocket being inside out.
Using a stretchy fabric for the entire pocket would be more useful, and add a flair of style.

Need to rethink the zip attachment, it has lead to big holes in the body.
